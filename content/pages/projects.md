Term Paper
----------

The goal of the term paper is to investigate a problem in contemporary AMO physics and to describe it lucidly and succinctly. If you have an original idea or proposal for a new theoretical project or an experiment of your own-even an experiment that doesn’t appear worth doing or is ultimately unworkable—that would be splendid. However, a review of some topic of contemporary research is perfectly acceptable, or if you want to extend a topic that was covered only briefly in class. The topic should not strongly overlap with your own research, but may be related. The length of the paper should be comparable, but not exceed that of a letter in Physical Review Letters (ie should have 15k-20k characters max). Follow the general style of PRL, including a short abstract and the convention for references. Illustrations may be sketched by hand or copied from the literature (with acknowledgment), either inserted in the text or collected at the end.

The paper is due on the last day of class. The grade will be based on physics contents (whether the important scientific parts are covered) and on clarity of exposition and style.

Possible Topics for Term Papers
-------------------------------

The following is a list of suggested topics. Check with the instructor if you would like to choose some other topic. This is your opportunity to choose the topic in which you have always been interested, but never found the time to elaborate on it! You might get ideas by browsing through recent conference proceedings or recent issues of Phys. Rev. Lett. In many cases, I might get you started with some references.
