## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _8.422 Atomic and Optical Physics II_ as it was taught by Professor Wolfgang Ketterle in Spring 2013.

This graduate-level course is the second of a two-semester subject sequence beginning with [_8.421 Atomic and Optical Physics I_](/courses/8-421-atomic-and-optical-physics-i-spring-2014) that provides the foundations for contemporary research in selected areas of atomic and optical physics.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

The purpose of this two-semester subject sequence is to introduce graduate students to the concepts of atomic physics and to prepare them for cutting-edge research.

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Cold atoms are often used to address problems of condensed matter physics, so many students who take this subject sequence go on to take [_8.511 Theory of Solids I_](/courses/8-511-theory-of-solids-i-fall-2004) and [_8.512 Theory of Solids II_](/courses/8-512-theory-of-solids-ii-spring-2009). Some students take a course, taught by Eugene Demler at Harvard, called [_Special Topics in Condensed Matter Physics_ (PDF)](http://cmt.harvard.edu/demler/TEACHING/p268r_2012.pdf). Others go on to take courses in quantum computation.

## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisite

[_8.05 Quantum Physics II_](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013)

### Requirements Satisfied

This course may be applied toward a [doctoral degree](http://catalog.mit.edu/schools/science/physics/#graduatetext) in physics with the approval of the candidate’s committee.

### Offered

Atomic physics is taught every spring semester, alternating between [_8.421 Atomic and Optical Physics I_](/courses/8-421-atomic-and-optical-physics-i-spring-2014) and _8.422 Atomic and Optical Physics II_. Depending on when they matriculate, students begin with either 8.421 or 8.422. It is somewhat more logical to go from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics, but the reverse sequence also works well.

## Assessment

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 50% Assignments
- 50% Term paper

## Student Information

### Enrollment

34 students

### Breakdown by Year

Graduate students

### Breakdown by Major

Predominantly physics majors

### Ideal Class Size

This class should have at least 10-15 students to allow for active discussions.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lecture

- Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 25 sessions total; voluntary attendance.
- Lectures typically began with a brief summary of previously covered content, an introduction to the focus of the current lecture, and a preview of what would be covered next.
- Lectures consisted of instructor-led presentations and questions from students.
- {{% resource_link 2761817d-4f43-e6f2-86ea-c1eb3b0928b5 "Clicker questions" %}} ![](/images/educator/icon-question-clickq.png) were occasionally used to gauge students’ understanding during lectures.

### Out of Class

- Students completed readings, problem sets, and a term paper.
